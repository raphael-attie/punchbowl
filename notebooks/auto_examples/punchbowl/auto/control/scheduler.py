    Implement the core logic of each scheduler flow.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query_ready_files_func
        A function that returns a list of lists, where each of the inner lists is a group of files that will be the
        inputs to one flow
    construct_child_file_info
        A function that generates the child File entries for one group/flow
    construct_child_flow_info
        A function that generates the Flow entry for one group
    pipeline_config
        The config or config path
    update_input_file_state
        Whether to change the state of the input files
    new_input_file_state
        The new state to assign to each input file
    session
        A database Session
    reference_time
        Some time of observation time associated with this scheduling run. The meaning is defined by flow-specific
        functions passed into this function.
    args_dictionary: dict
         Values in this dictionary are passed directly to the
         `query_ready_files_func`, `query_ready_files_func`, and `construct_child_flow_info` functions
    children_are_one_to_one
        By default, for each group of input files, it is assumed that all inputs together produce all the output
        files, and FileRelationships are generated accordingly. In a case where a batch of input files are to be
        processed in one flow, this assumption doesn't hold. When this flag is set to True, it is assumed each input
        file connects to only one output file (at the corresponding position in the list of child File objects).
