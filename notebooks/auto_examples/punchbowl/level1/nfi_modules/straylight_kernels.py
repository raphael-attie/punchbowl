    Generate an image of a kernel at a specific position.

    This single kernel is meant to be the out-of-focus image of a single point on the occulter ring. A bunch of
    options are provided for adjusting how that kernel looks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    theta : float
        The angular position of the center of the kernel, CCW from the +x axis
    radial_size : float
        The size of the kernel in pixels. ("Radial" here means "radial out from image-center".)
    aspect_ratio : float
        The aspect ratio of the kernel. The size of the kernel perpendicular to the radial direction is
        aspect_ratio * radial_size. ("Radial" here means "radial out from image-center".)
    right_intensity : float
        Used to create an intensity gradient. For a kernel at theta=0, the intensity will vary linearly from 1 at the
        left edge to this value at the right edge. For theta != 0, the gradient direction rotates with the kernel.
    bottom_intensity : float
        Used to create an intensity gradient. For a kernel at theta=0, the intensity will vary linearly from 1 at the
        top edge to this value at the bottom edge. For theta != 0, the gradient direction rotates with the kernel.
    elon_abs : float | None
        Set the distance from the center of the image to the center of the kernel. This is measured in pixels, but it is
        otherwise the elongation angle of the kernel relative to the image center.
    elon_offset : float
        Offset the distance from the center of the image to the center of the kernel. This is measured in pixels, but it
        is otherwise the elongation angle of the kernel relative to the image center. Not used if elon_abs is set.
    blur : float
        If non-zero, a Gaussian blur is applied to the final kernel image. This parameter sets the standard deviation of
        the Gaussian in pixels.
    image_size : int
        The size of the (square) output image, in pixels.
        Flexibility provided to account for binning (downsampling) data for computational efficiency
    oversamp : int
        If set, the kernel profile is computed on an over-sampled grid and downsampled to the final output size. This
        allows pixels at the edge of the kernel to have values between 0 and 1, rather
        than having a sharp drop from 1 to 0 at the kernel edge (assuming a gradient-free kernel). This parameter sets
        the amount of oversampling in each dimension.
    cx, cy : int
        The x and y coordinate around which the kernel is rotated (by the theta parameter). This coordinate then becomes
        the center of the disk of kernels once kernels are computed for all theta values.
    r_profile : Callable
        Allows an arbitrary radial intensity profile to be provided. The callable should receive a 2D numpy array
        indicating the radial component (i.e. radial-out from image-center) of the pixel's location relative to the
        kernel center, expressed as a fraction of the kernel radius, and should return an array of the same shape
        providing a scale factor for each pixel.
    dtype : str
        The dtype to use for the output array
