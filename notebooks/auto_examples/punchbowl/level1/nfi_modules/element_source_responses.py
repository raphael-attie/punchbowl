def element_source_responses(source, detector, transform, n_buffers=10**7, dtype="float32"):
    """
    Generate the sparse response matrix for the general linear forward problem,
    mediated by a pair of coordinate systems and a coordinate transform.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    source: SourceGrid
        An object which defines a set of indexed source, or basis, elements.
        The ElementGrid class is the exemplar for these objects.
        They must implement an elements method as well as
        nelm, nadr, and coords attributes with usage consistent with their
        definitions in element_grid.
    detector: DetectorGrid
        An object which defines a set of detector elements.
        The ElementGrid class is the exemplar for these objects.
        They must implement a response method as well as nelm and coords attributes
        with usage consistent with their definitions in ElementGrid.
    transform: Callable
        A function which returns an object that maps points in the source
        coordinate system to the detector coordinate system.
        The callable must only take the `coords` attributes of a `SourceGrid` and `DetectorGrid` object.
        This callable should also return a callable object that takes points of the source coordinate
        system as input.
        This coordinate transform does not need to be reversible (e.g., the source system
        can be 3D and the detector system can be 2D) -- only the forward
        direction must be well defined. Naturally, this may result in a
        singular response matrix.
    n_buffers: int, default = 10**7
        The number of buffers.
        Buffers are used to limit the overhead used to update the sparse matrices.
    dtype: dtype, default = "float32"
        Type constraint for computation speed, memory use, and/or calculation precision.
    Returns:
    --------
    response_matrix: scipy.csc_matrix
        Compressed Sparse response matrix

    Notes:
    -----
    There is a close mathematical relationship between source and detector
    elements -- almost all of their implementation code in ElementGrid is
    shared, and if they're swapped in the call to this routine, the result
    should merely be the transpose of the response matrix (untested).
