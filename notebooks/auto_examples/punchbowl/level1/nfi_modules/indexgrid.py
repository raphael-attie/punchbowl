class CoordGrid:
    """
    This implements the notion of a grid of coordinate points that are meant to be indexed by integers.
    The basic class includes implementation for an affine (linear transformation) grid, but more general
    coordinate systems will not be hard to extend. The transformation from the indices into the coordinate
    points here should be reversible or the inds and flatinds methods will not work.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dims : np.array
        The dimensions of the source grid, a 1-D array containing [nx0,nx1,...]
    origin : np.array
        The location of the center of the [0,0,...] pixel in the grid
    fwd : np.array
        The forward transformation matrix
    inv : np.array
        The inverse of the forward transformation matrix
    frame : TrivialFrame
        Information about the coordinate frame. Not used by the CoordGrid itself, but
            may be used by other routines that want to transform between grids.

    Methods
    -------
    get_grid_inverse()
        Routine to set up the parameters of the grid inverse (from coordinates to indices)
        operation.
    subgrid(fac=2)
        Get a grid that's clocked to this grid, but is higher resolution by an integer factor.
    identity()
        Get the identity grid for this grid.
    get_indices_from_coordinates(coords)
        Returns indices given a set of coordinates.
    get_coordinates_from_indices(inds)
        Returns coordinates given a set of indices.
    get_flattened_indices(vals,coords,thold=0)
        Returns the 'flattened' indices given a set of coordinates.

            The location of the center of the [0,0,...] pixel in the grid
        forward :  np.array
            The information needed to define the forward transformation (i.e., from
            indices to coordinates), in addition to the origin. For the affine
            transformation, this is an nd by nd matrix, where nd is the number of dimensions.

        Returns indices given a set of coordinates. Does no discretize for various reasons.
        Order is reversed, and the inv operator transposed, due to how numpy array broadcasting
        and matrix operations interact. Because coords returns coordinates reference to the
        centers of the grid elements, discretization of these indices should be done with
        rounding, not flooring (see flatinds). The domain of each grid element extends
        0.5 grid spacings to each side.
