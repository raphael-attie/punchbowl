def create_coefficient_image(flat_coefficients: np.ndarray, image_shape: tuple) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Given a set of coefficients that should apply for every pixel, convert them to the required format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flat_coefficients : np.ndarray
        A one-dimensional list of coefficients that should apply to every pixel in the image.
        Coefficients should be ordered from the highest power to lowest as expected in `photometric_calibration`, e.g.
        f(i,j) = a+b*IMG[i,j]+c*IMG[i,j]^2 would have flat_coefficients of [c, b, a]
    image_shape : tuple
        A tuple of the shape of the image that will be calibrated using `photometric_calibration`

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        An image of coefficients that apply to every pixel as expected by `photometric_calibration`

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_shape : tuple[Int]
        size of the image to create the coefficients for

def photometric_calibration(image: np.ndarray, coefficient_image: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute a non-linear photometric calibration of PUNCH images.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        Image to be corrected.

    coefficient_image : np.ndarray
        Frame containing uncertainty values.
        The first two dimensions are the spatial dimensions of the image.
        The last dimension iterates over the powers of the coefficients, starting with index 0 being the highest power
        and counting down.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        a photometrically corrected frame

    Notes
    -----
    Each instrument is subject to an independent non-linear photometric response,
    which needs to be corrected. The module converts from raw camera digitizer
    number (DN) to photometric units at each pixel. Each pixel is replaced with
    the corresponding value of the quartic polynomial in the current calibration file data
    product for that particular camera.

    A quartic polynomial is applied as follows:

    .. math:: X_{i,j} = a_{i,j}+b_{i,j}*DN_{i,j}+c_{i,j}*DN_{i,j}^2+d_{i,j}*DN_{i,j}^3+e_{i,j}*DN_{i,j}^4

    for each pixel in the detector. Each quantity (a, b, c, d, e) is a function
    of pixel location (i,j), and is generated using dark current and Stim lamp
    maps. a = offset (dark and the bias). b, c, d, e = higher order terms.
    Specifically ``coefficient_image[:,i,j] = [e, d, c, b, a]`` (highest order terms first)

    As each pixel is independent, a quartic fit calibration file of
    dimensions 2k*2k*5 is constructed, with each layer containing one of the five
    polynomial coefficients for each pixel.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> punch_image = np.ones((100,100))
    >>> coefficient_image = create_coefficient_image(np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 0]), punch_image.shape)
    >>> data = photometric_calibration(punch_image, coefficient_image)
