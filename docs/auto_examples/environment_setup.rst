===================
Environment setup
===================

To run the sample notebooks contained within punchbowl, you must first create a Python environment.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-13

To run the sample notebooks contained within punchbowl, you must first create a Python environment. These days, it's recommended to have a local virtual environment for a project rather than a global configuration.
If using an environment for running Jupyter notebooks (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc), this environment setup may be handled automatically or through UI prompts on notebook execution.
Note that for a full environment setup, including full PUNCH requirements, see the instructions linked at the `punch-mission README <https://github.com/punch-mission/punch-mission?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-the-punch-environment>`_.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-22

To set up manually, start within a terminal, and navigate to the directory in which you want to work with notebooks.
Begin by setting up a virtual environment within the specified directory. Here we'll setup a hidden directory .venv

.. code-block:: shell

  python -m venv .venv


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-30

Next activate the virtual environment by executing the activation script. Note that when returning to this environment in future, you'll also need to activate the environment once again.

.. code-block:: shell

  source .venv/bin/activate


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-38

To get started quickly with punchbowl, one can install a few packages using pip. Other packages of note can be installed in this same way.

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install ipykernel jupyter punchbowl


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-46

From here, one can open a downloaded notebook in an editor of choice (selecting the local virtual environment), or by calling jupyter directly.

.. code-block:: shell

  jupyter downloaded_notebook.ipynb
