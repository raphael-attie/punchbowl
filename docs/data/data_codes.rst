Data Product Codes
====================

PUNCH data products are organized into data processing levels from Level 0 (raw camera data) to Level 3 (calibrated science data). Within and across levels distinct data products and calibration files are marked with a unique identifying product code. For data in the spacecraft frame, each spacecraft is marked with a unique numeral identity - 1,2,3 for each WFI, or 4 for NFI.

Note that most PUNCH FITS data products contain the primary data within the first extension HDU, with corresponding uncertainties stored in the second extension HDU.
