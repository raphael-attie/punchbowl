Accessing PUNCH Data
====================

Recommended Level 3 Products
-----------------------------
For most science use cases, the recommended starting point is the two Level 3 low-noise science mosaic products,
**PAM** and **CAM**.
Both products are fully background and starfield subtracted and mosaicked across the PUNCH field of view,
giving you the cleanest possible signal for heliospheric science.
Each of these two product types are produced every 32 minutes, allowing multiple images to be averaged together at every point in the mosiac field of view,
offering improved signal-to-noise relative to other products.
PAM files (with the "P" standing for "polarized") have three data layers: total brightness (tB), which is effectively an unpolarized image, followed by
polarized brightness (pB) and its radial component (pB', also referred to as pBp), making PAM the product of
choice for studies of CMEs, shocks, the solar wind, etc.
CAM files (with the "C" standing for "clear") provide only unpolarized data. The PAMs' unpolarized total brightness is reconstructed from sets of polarized
observations, while the CAMs are produced from unpolarized observations which are made at a reduced cadence. So while the total brightness layer of the PAMs
is conceptually equivalent to the CAMs, PAMs average together more data, which is expected to provide better signal-to-noise. But for memory- or
bandwidth-constrained situations that don't require polarization, CAMs provide largely equivalent data at one-third the file size.

If you are unsure which product to start with, download a CAM or PAM file first.

Downloading Data
----------------
Data output from the PUNCH data processing pipeline are stored and accessible through the Solar Data Analysis Center (SDAC)
- a portal for hosting through tools such as the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO).
From here PUNCH data products can be queried and requested for download using metadata within the data products.
See `this example <https://punchbowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/querying_data.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-querying-data-py>`_ on how to query the VSO using
SunPy's Fido API.

If that example is not working properly, you can also pull data directly from the SDAC using ``wget``.

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -e robots=off -r -l1 --no-parent --no-directories -A "PUNCH_L3_CAM_20250921*_v0l.fits" -R "*.html*,index*,*tmp*" https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/punch/3/CAM/2025/09/21/

The above example would pull data for the L3_CAM products on 2025-09-21.
Change the path and date according to what product you wish to download.

PUNCH data are also accessible using the Helioviewer tool,
where it can be quickly visualized and stitched together with other observations for context.

Reading Data
------------
Standard PUNCH data is stored as a standards-compliant FITS file, which bundles the primary data along with secondary data and metadata fully describing the observation.
Each file is named with a convention that uniquely identifies the product - a sample being 'PUNCH_L3_PAM_20230704000000_v1.fits' - where L3 defines the data level,
PAM is an example of a particular data product code, 20230704000000 is a timestamp in the format yyyymmddhhmmss, and _v1 is the version of the data.

For most end-users the primary data of interest are PAM (low-noise full frame data gathered over one full spacecraft rotation cycle) and PTM (high-cadence trefoil mosaics).

PUNCH FITS files are RICE compressed, reducing the overall file size while preserving data fidelity.
Due to this compression, the zeroth HDU of each output data file contains information about the compression scheme.
The first HDU (``hdul[1]``) contains the primary data array, along with an astropy header string describing that data.
The second HDU (``hdul[2]``) contains the uncertainty array - corresponding on a pixel-by-pixel basis with the primary data array.

These data are compatible with standard astropy FITS libraries, and can be read in as following the example,

.. code-block:: python

    filename = 'example_data/PUNCH_L3_PAM_20240620000000.fits'

    with fits.open(filename) as hdul:
        data = hdul[1].data
        header = hdul[1].header
        uncertainty = hdul[2].data

These data can also be bundled together as an NDCube object, either manually or using some of the bundled IO tools within punchbowl. For instance,

.. code-block:: python

    from punchbowl.data.punch_io import load_ndcube_from_fits

    filename = 'example_data/PUNCH_L3_PAM_20240620000000.fits'

    cube = load_ndcube_from_fits(filename)

See `this code example <https://punchbowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/data_guide.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-data-guide-py>`_ on how to use data.

Data Projections
----------------
The PUNCH WFI instruments extend their field of view out to around 45-degrees from the Sun,
creating a meshed virtual observatory extending to a diameter of nearly 180 solar radii.
The wide nature of this field of view requires attention to the data projection being used for these data.

For NFI data, the standard projection is a Gnomonic (TAN) coordinate system with distortion,
a standard system employed for many data peering closer towards the sun.

For individual WFI data, an azimuthal perspective (AZP) coordinate system with distortion is used.

For full mosaics that combine data from WFI and NFI, an azimuthal equidistant (ARC) coordinate system is used,
with data from each spacecraft frame aligned and projected to this standardized frame.

Each data contains a set of World Coordinate System (WCS) parameters that describe the coordinates of the data,
in both a helioprojective and celestial frame.
